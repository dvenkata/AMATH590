AMATH 590 (Special Topics): Deep Learning in Fluid Mechanics

Topics Studied:
1. Reconstruction of Fluid Flow from limited measurements (sensors)
2. Turbulence Closure Models for Large Eddy Simulation

Project:
I use data from Johns Hopkins Turbulence database, and attempt three types of analysis:
i) Flow Reconstruction
ii) Time-stepping/ Flowmaps
iii) Model sub-grid scales
