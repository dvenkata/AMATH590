AMATH 590 (Special Topics): Deep Learning in Fluid Mechanics

Topics Studied:
1. Reconstruction of Fluid Flow from limited measurements (sensors) (https://github.com/dvenkata/AMATH590/blob/main/99.%20Submission/Archive/AMATH590_PaperReview_Deepak_1940141_.pdf)
2. Closure Models for Large Eddy Simulation (https://github.com/dvenkata/AMATH590/blob/main/99.%20Submission/Archive/AMATH590_LiteratureReview_Deepak_1940141_.pdf)

Project: I use data from Johns Hopkins Turbulence database, and try the below:
1. Flow Reconstruction
2. Time-stepping/ Flowmaps
3. Model sub-grid scales
